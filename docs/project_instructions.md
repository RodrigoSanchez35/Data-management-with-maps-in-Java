# Project Instructions: Ticket Sales Management with Maps in Java

## Problem Statement
A theater needs a system to manage ticket sales for different events. The system should:
1. Allow users to select **events** and **seating categories**.
2. Apply **discounts** based on user type (students, seniors).
3. Keep track of **ticket availability**.
4. Provide a **sales summary** and **revenue calculation**.

## Requirements
- The program must use **maps (`HashMap`)** to store:
  - Event names and prices.
  - Seat types and their respective prices.
- The system should prevent **overbooking**.
- The system should provide **receipts and summaries**.

## Example Output
Event: Rolling Stones Concert Seat: VIP Base Price: $22000 Discount Applied: 15% Final Price: $18700 Ticket Sold!

## How to Run the Project

   cd Ticket-Sales-Management-Java
   
2. Compile and execute:
   javac src/TicketManagementSystem.java
   java src.TicketManagementSystem

This script will create **docs/project_instructions.md** in a **single execution** with all the necessary information. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need any modifications!
